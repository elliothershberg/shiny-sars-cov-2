```{r echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

I want to just get the start and end genomic coordinates, and the mutation information.

The mutation is in the form of: amino acid, position, substitution.

```{r}
spike_mutations <- read_tsv("spikeMuts.bed", col_names = FALSE) %>%
  select(
    chrom_start = X2,
    chrom_end = X3,
    mutation = X4
  )

spike_mutations
```

```{r}
write_tsv(spike_mutations, "spike-mutations.tsv")
```
